|        Language:  [C]
|  Compile/Run:  [Two options are provided to compile to program, make and gcc. printError.h validation.h display.h must be in directory!!!! ]
|       [MAKE]:  Inside the directory validation.c printError.c printError.h validation.h display.c display.h
|               $make
|        [GCC]:  Inside the directory containing validation.c printError.c printError.h validation.h
|               $gcc -std=c99 validation.c printError.c â€“o validationMain
|        [RUN (STAND-ALONE]: validation can be used standalone (stand alone it will read from stdin and print to stdout
|                               dates that were found to be valid until either end of stream  (EOF) or  number of valid
|                               dates found equals the numbers desired (passed as an argument).
|                               DESIRED NUMBER OF VALID ENTRIES must be a positive integer (0 to INT_MAX).
|                               0 for all entries till EOF
|               $ ./validation [DESIRED NUMBER OF VALID ENTRIES]
|       [RUN COMBINED] : combined with display, this program will process the input from stdin and send it to main
|                           to be displayed in the specified format as per the specifications.
|               $ ./validationMain [DESIRED NUMBER OF VALID ENTRIES] | ./displayMain

|  Description:  [This program will read dates from stdin and validate that it is a valid date. A valid date is a date
|                   who's month is between JAN (1) and DEC (12) and the days is between 1 and total days in that month.
|                   A year is considered to be valid so long as it is in the range of INT_MIN to INT_MAX. ]
|
|        Input: [Input will be read from stdin (what ever that might be) and attempted to construct into a date.
|                 if successful, the date will be validated to make sure that it conforms to what a valid date is as
|                 explained the section above.]
|       Output: [If the date constructed from the input is considered to be valid, it will be printed to stdout (what ever
|                   that might be). Several messages will be printed to stderr if any errors or warnings occur during the
|                    execution. ]
|      Process: [ We start by storing the input coming from stdin into a buffer and then using sscanf we attempt to
|                   convert the input into a date, if it fails to read the input, the input is discarded, if successful
|                   a date is constructed and passed along for validation. if validated it will be printed to stdout.]
