|        Language:  [C]
|  Compile/Run:  [Two options are provided to compile to program, make and gcc. printError.h validation.h display.h must be in directory!!!! ]
|       [MAKE]:  Inside the directory validation.c printError.c printError.h validation.h display.c display.h
|               $make
|        [GCC]:  Inside the directory containing validation.c printError.c printError.h validation.h
|               $gcc -std=c99 display.c printError.c â€“o displayMain
|        [RUN (STAND-ALONE]: running in standalone mode, display will not validate the input,
|                               it will attempt to convert all input from stdin to a date as specified with the
|                               specifications. This will not stop until end of the stream has been reached (EOF)
|               $ ./displayMain
|       [RUN COMBINED] : combined with display, this program will process the input from stdin and send it to main
|                           to be displayed in the specified format as per the specifications.
|               $ ./validationMain [DESIRED NUMBER OF VALID ENTRIES] | ./displayMain

|
|  Description:  [This program will take the input from stdin assume is a valid date and convert it into a string for the
|                  specified format (see project specifications). After the end of the stream from stdin has been reached
|                   or the sentinel value is detected (-1), the program will open "Dates.dat" (assumed to be in the same
|                   directory as the executable) and read the contents of the file and print it to stdout. ]
|
|        Input: [display assumes that the value coming in from stdin is a previously validated date and will transform it
|                   into the string as per the specifications. After that section is complete it will then read input from
|                   "Dates.dat" file (assumed to be in the same directory as the executable).]
|       Output: [The new date string will be printed to stdout as well as the contents of "Dates.dat", error messages will be
|                   printed to stderr. ]
|      Process: [ read string from stdin, convert it into a date type, print the date in the specified format. When stdin
|                   has reached EOF or sentinel value is detected, open "Dates.dat" for reading and prints ints contents to
|                   stdout.]
